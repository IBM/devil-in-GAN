# devil-in-GAN

This repo consists of two demos from the work described in [The Devil is in the GAN: Defending Deep Generative Models Against Backdoor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01644).

- [Attacking StyleGAN](https://github.com/IBM/devil-in-GAN/blob/main/notebooks/Attacking%20StyleGAN.ipynb)
- [Attacking WaveGAN](https://github.com/IBM/devil-in-GAN/blob/main/notebooks/Attacking%20WaveGAN.ipynb) 

In order to run these notebooks, pleaase download [this zip files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1coCJrSAKzVb3yESRMT9xZVtDFr6ibrVv/view?usp=sharing) and extract its contents in the home directory.
